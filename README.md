# Haskell Pascal Compiler

Toy Pascal compiler written in Haskell using an adapted version of
the incremental approach outlined in 
[this paper](http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf).

Currently implements a very small (but slowly growing) subset of
the language.

## Progress

Increments:

- [X] Integers
- [X] Binary Operators on Ints
- [ ] Unary Operators on Ints
- [ ] Variables and Assignment
- [ ] Booleans and Comparisons
- [ ] WriteLn("Hello World") (finally)
- [ ] Branching (if statements)
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Procedures
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Records
- [ ] Pointers
